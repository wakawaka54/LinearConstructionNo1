# 3D Model of modern art piece by Naum Gabo - "Linear Construction No. 1"

This 3D model was created with Autodesk Inventor 2015. I have modeled this art piece in a way that can be laser cut and assembled.

Note: The middle circular piece from acrlyic is not included in this model to allow for easier assembly.
